# Agentic Layer Concept Map

Logical map + technical choices and their *why*. For the write flow in detail: `03-INFRA/vault-write-architecture.md`. For the project, register and backlog: `02-PROJECTS/`.

## Principle: one soul, many machines

The user runs one agent system across multiple CLIs and machines that must act as a single soul. Behaviour, MCP config, skills, and memory each have ONE canonical source in the vault; what each CLI or machine sees is a GENERATED, read-only derivative.

## Topology

```

   BEHAVIOUR            CONFIG (MCP)                  MEMORY              HOOKS
   AGENTS.md        manifest.yaml +               KnowledgeVault      checkpoint hook
   (1 file,         render.py →                   (markdown notes)    (per-CLI, optional)
   every CLI)       per-CLI dialect
```

## The three planes

1. **Behaviour** — `AGENTS.md` is the single bootstrap. Every CLI's pointer file references it. One file, every agent, drift impossible.
2. **Config** — `mcp/manifest.yaml` describes every MCP server once; `render.py` translates it into each CLI's dialect. Every local MCP package launched through `npx` has an exact version pin, so an upgrade is a tested engine change rather than an implicit upstream update. `skills/skills.manifest.yaml` does the same for skills. GitHub skills declare a full commit SHA, and `skills-sync.py` fetches and checks that exact object before materializing it.
3. **Memory** — the KnowledgeVault (markdown notes, Git-backed). Written through one door per type: notes via the `vault-library` MCP, infra files via `vault-push`.

## Why one source

Hand-patching per-CLI configs creates drift: one CLI behaves differently from another, one machine falls behind, a fix on one side does not propagate. The single-source + provisioner model means a change is made once and carries everywhere. The cost is the provisioner machinery; the benefit is a system that stays coherent as it grows.

## Guardians

- **`agent-sync`** — reconciles live configs with the canonical sources on each machine.
- **`agent-doctor`** — the single diagnostic: git state, MCP reachability, instruction drift, env tokens, skills, local worker. The only command to run by hand when something seems off.
- **healthcheck step (inside `agent-sync`)** — grouped health summary; sends an alert only on FAIL. Was a standalone `agent-healthcheck.sh`, folded into `agent_sync.py`.
- **`vault-lifecycle-audit.py`** — read-only heat-map for vault grooming candidates.

## Cross-platform definition of done

No architecture change is "done" until it is carried and verified on every machine and CLI it touches. The map is part of "done": if a change alters the architecture, update this map in the same pass.
